To compile the code, you can follow the following steps:

1. type "make clean" to remove some redundant files
2. type "make" to build the executable file "prod_con"
3. type "./prod_con" to run the program
4. check some log files in the directory
5. you'd better type "make clean" everytime you want to build it again
